# Toast Notifications Implementation

## Overview

Toast notifications have been implemented throughout the application using **Sonner** - a beautiful, accessible toast notification library for React.

---

## Installation

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add sonner
npm i --save-dev @types/papaparse
```

## Implementation

### 1. **Root Layout** (`app/layout.tsx`)

Added `<Toaster />` component to display all toast notifications globally.

```tsx
import { Toaster } from "@/components/ui/sonner";

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        {children}
        <Toaster />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

## Toast Features

### ✨ **Built-in Features**

1. **Auto-dismiss**: Toasts automatically disappear after a few seconds
2. **Action buttons**: Can add action buttons to toasts
3. **Promise toasts**: Show loading → success/error states
4. **Rich content**: Support for custom React components
5. **Positioning**: Configurable toast position
6. **Theming**: Automatically adapts to your app's theme
7. **Accessibility**: Fully accessible with ARIA attributes

### 🎨 **Customization**

You can customize the Toaster in `app/layout.tsx`:

```tsx
<Toaster position="top-right" expand={true} richColors closeButton />
```

**Available Positions:**

- `top-left`
- `top-center`
- `top-right` (default)

## Benefits

✅ **Consistent UX** - Unified notification experience across the app

## Migration from Alerts

### Before (using alerts):

```

### After (using toasts):

```tsx
toast.success("User created successfully!", {
  description: "The user has been added to the system.",
});
```

---

## Advanced Usage

### Promise Toast (for async operations)

```tsx
const promise = saveData();

toast.promise(promise, {
  loading: "Saving...",
  success: "Data saved!",
  error: "Save failed",
});
```

### Custom Duration

```tsx
toast.success("Saved!", {
  duration: 5000, // 5 seconds
});
```

### With Action Button

```tsx
toast.success("Changes saved", {
  description: "Your profile has been updated.",
  action: {
    label: "Undo",
    onClick: () => handleUndo(),
  },
});
```
